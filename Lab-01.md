# Lab 01: Cloud-Based RAG Chatbot System
**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Status:** Completed  

## 🎯 Objective
Deploy a secure, serverless Retrieval Augmented Generation system using AWS managed services to enable controlled access to institutional knowledge via a conversational interface.


## 🛠️ Tools Used
* AWS S3, AWS Bedrock, AWS Lex, AWS IAM, AWS Lambda, AWS Amplify


## 🔍 Key Findings
1. Serverless architectures significantly reduce operational overhead while maintaining scalability
2. RAG improves response accuracy by grounding model outputs in controlled data sources.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
This project demonstrated that conversational AI systems produce significantly more accurate and reliable responses when grounded in a curated knowledge base rather than relying on model inference alone. By integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation, the chatbot was able to reference stored institutional documents, reducing hallucinations and ensuring responses aligned with verified data sources.
